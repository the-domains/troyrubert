description: 'A second attempt to launch a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying a powerful communications satellite was called off at the last minute Thursday evening because of apparent problems loading the booster with super-cooled liquid oxygen. Already running a day late because of a temperature-related propellant issue, the countdown was ticking smoothly toward liftoff at 6:47 p.m.'
